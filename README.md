# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis
This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project has delved into cancellations and their underlying patterns, proposing strategies to mitigate cancellations and enhance revenue.

The project has examined booking data for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, encompassing details such as booking dates, length of stay, and guest demographics. It has navigated through the fundamental stages of EDA and visualization.

In this endeavor, I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided dataset, aiming to identify actionable insights. For instance, hotels might have considered offering early booking discounts or extended stay promotions to incentivize guests. Moreover, providing perks like complimentary parking or breakfast for direct bookings could have swayed customers away from third-party platforms.

This EDA has comprised three primary phases:
1. Exploration and scrutiny of raw data.
2. Data refinement, addressing null values, and removing irrelevant entries.
3. Analysis breakdown:
   - Univariate analysis: Examining individual variables.
   - Bivariate analysis: Investigating relationships between pairs of variables.
   - Multivariate analysis: Exploring interactions among multiple variables.

By scrutinizing hotel booking data and deciphering cancellation trends, hotels can have strategized to curtail cancellations and bolster revenue streams.
