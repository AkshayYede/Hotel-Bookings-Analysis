# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis
This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project delves into cancellations and their underlying patterns, proposing strategies to mitigate cancellations and enhance revenue.

The project examines booking data for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, encompassing details such as booking dates, length of stay, and guest demographics. It navigates through the fundamental stages of EDA and visualization.

In this endeavor, I will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided dataset, aiming to identify actionable insights. For instance, hotels might consider offering early booking discounts or extended stay promotions to incentivize guests. Moreover, providing perks like complimentary parking or breakfast for direct bookings could sway customers away from third-party platforms.

This EDA comprises three primary phases:
1. Exploration and scrutiny of raw data.
2. Data refinement, addressing null values, and removing irrelevant entries.
3. Analysis breakdown:
   - Univariate analysis: Examining individual variables.
   - Bivariate analysis: Investigating relationships between pairs of variables.
   - Multivariate analysis: Exploring interactions among multiple variables.

By scrutinizing hotel booking data and deciphering cancellation trends, hotels can strategize to curtail cancellations and bolster revenue streams.
